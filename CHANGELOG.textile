h1. Release Notes

1.0.4 Bug Fix

* The build branch now has the same name as the branch on the remote repository.  Previously, due to the way I was creating the local branch on the build agent, it always calling all the build branch "master". "Issue 11":http://github.com/andypols/git-bamboo-plugin/issues/issue/11.

* Supports Submodules 

* Renamed plugin dropdown to "Git", since it works with none GitHub repositories.

1.0.3 Bug Fix

* Now works correctly with remote agents (the server didn't have a local copy of the repository and therefore failed to calculate the change set).  Thanks to "Michael Rowe":http://mikerowecode.com for spotting this.

1.0.2 Bug Fix

* Handle case where we had a date for the previous build, but can't extract the latest update from the logs...

1.0.1 Bug Fix

* Fixed a silly bug. I was validating some fields that had been removed from the UI, so bamboo wouldn't let the user progress past the guthub page when creating a new repository. 
* Handle timezone information in the git logs correctly
