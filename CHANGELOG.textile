h2. Release Notes

1.0.3 Bug Fix

* Now works correctly with remote agents (the server didn't have a local copy of the repository and therefore failed to calculate the change set).  Thanks to "Michael Rowe":http://mikerowecode.com for spotting this.

1.0.2 Bug Fix

* Handle case where we had a date for the previous build, but can't extract the latest update from the logs...

1.0.1 Bug Fix

* Fixed a silly bug. I was validating some fields that had been removed from the UI, so bamboo wouldn't let the user progress past the guthub page when creating a new repository. 
* Handle timezone information in the git logs correctly

1.0 First Release
