h1. A Git Plugin for the Bamboo builder server

Build your GitHub repositories on the Amazon Cloud using "Atlassian's Bamboo":http://atlassian.com/bamboo (version 2.2 or greater)...

* Adds the option “GitHub” to the list of available repositories when you add or edit a plan.
* Shows the changes that triggered the build.
* Trigger the build via a GitHub Service Hook (Fires service hook on each commit)
* Links the commit code changes back to the GitHub page containing the commit/diff.

h2. Installation

Install git (http://git-scm.com/).

Copy the git-repository jar to @$BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@.

Restart Bamboo.

You can tell bamboo where the git executable is located using the @GIT_HOME@ environment variable.

h2. Build from source

Define the @bamboo.server.lib@ value in the @build.xml@ so the build has access to the bamboo jars (Bamboo is commercial, so I can't include them the github repository).

Run the @ant all@ task.
