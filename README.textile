h1. A Git Plugin for the Bamboo builder server

Build your git and GitHub repositories on the Amazon Cloud using Bamboo...

* Adds the option “GitHub” to the repository provider when you add or edit a plan.
* Shows the changes that triggered the build.

h2. Installation

Install git (http://git-scm.com/).

Copy the git-repository jar to @$BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@.

Restart Bamboo.

You can tell bamboo where the git executable is located using the @GIT_HOME@ environment variable.  If this is not set,
Bamboo will try and discover the git executable using the @which git@ unix command.

h2. Build from source

Copy the jmock2 (http://www.jmock.org/) and atlassian bamboo jars into the lib directory (Bamboo is commercial, so I can't include them the github repository).

Run the @ant all@ task.
