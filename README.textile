h1. A Git Plugin for the Bamboo build server

Version 1.0

Build your GitHub repositories on the Amazon Cloud using "Atlassian's Bamboo":http://atlassian.com/bamboo.

* Adds the option “GitHub” to the list of available repositories when you add or edit a plan.
* Shows the changes that triggered the build.
* Trigger the build via a GitHub Service Hook.
* Links the commit code changes back to the GitHub page containing the commit/diff.
* Works with Bamboo version 2.2 or greater.

More information on the "Project's wiki":http://wiki.github.com/andypols/git-bamboo-plugin.

h2. Installation

Install git (http://git-scm.com/).

Copy the git-repository jar to @$BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@.

Run @exec ssh-agent bash@ and @ssh-add deployment-key@ before running Bamboo.  Bamboo will use the key stored in the agent to fetch the changes from GitHub.

The plugin will try and find the git command-line binary. Alternatively, you can tell bamboo where the git binary is located using the @GIT_HOME@ environment variable.
    
h2. Build from source

Define the @bamboo.server.lib@ value in the @build.xml@ so the build has access to the bamboo jars (Bamboo is commercial, so I can't include them the github repository).

Run the @ant all@ task.
