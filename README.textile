h1. A Git Plugin for the Bamboo build server

Version 1.0.4

Build your Git repositories on the Amazon Cloud using "Atlassian's Bamboo":http://atlassian.com/bamboo.

* Adds the option “Git” to the list of available repositories when you add or edit a plan.
* Shows the changes that triggered the build.
* Can trigger the build via a GitHub Service Hook.
* Links GitHub repository changes back to the GitHub page containing the commit/diff.
* Works with Bamboo version 2.2 or greater (Does not work on the latest release due to API changes - see Issue #13)
* Assumes Bamboo is running on *nix (tested on Ubuntu and OSX).  Would need tweaking for windows.

More information on the "Project's wiki":http://wiki.github.com/andypols/git-bamboo-plugin.

NOTE: The trigger on change feature has stopped working since github moved from engineyard to rackspace. Bamboo's  TriggerRemoteBuild checks that the IP address of the source repository matches the IP address of the build trigger. The trigger now *comes from a different IP and is rejected by Bamboo*. I have raised the following jira with the bamboo team: "BAM-4713":http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-4713.  Vote on it to get it fixed!!!  The short term fix is to poll for changes instead.

h2. Bamboo Compatibility

|_. File |_. Bamboo Version |
| git-repository-1.0.4.jar | 2.0/2.1/2.2/2.3/2.4 |

h2. Installation

Install git (http://git-scm.com/).

Copy the git-repository jar to @$BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@.

Run @exec ssh-agent bash@ and @ssh-add deployment-key@ before running Bamboo.  Bamboo will use the key stored in the agent to fetch the changes from GitHub.

The plugin will try and find the git command-line binary. Alternatively, you can tell bamboo where the git binary is located using the @GIT_HOME@ environment variable.
    
h2. Build from source

Define the @bamboo.server.lib@ value in the @build.xml@ so the build has access to the bamboo jars (Bamboo is commercial, so I can't include them the github repository).

Run the @ant all@ task.
